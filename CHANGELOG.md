# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Language

- **`if/else` as expression**: `let x = if cond { a } else { b };` now
  produces a value at any expression position. Both branches must be a
  single expression of the same type; codegen lowers it to a C ternary
  so there's no extra runtime cost. `else` is required.
  Statement-position `if` (with `{ stmt; stmt; }` blocks) is unchanged.
- **Integer-literal widening**: literals that don't fit in 32-bit `int`
  (e.g. `19_999_999_998`) now infer as `i64` instead of silently
  truncating. The most visible effect was inside macros like
  `assert_eq!` that did `let __t = $a;` and dropped i64 constants on
  the floor.

### LSP performance

The LSP path was rewritten around an arena allocator after a session of
chasing per-keystroke leaks that crept the long-running `glide lsp`
process toward 30+ GiB during normal editing.

- **Per-keystroke arena**: every Vector / HashMap / AST node allocated
  by parse / expand / lower / type runs in a chunked bump arena owned
  by the active document. The next reanalysis frees the prior arena
  in bulk via `munmap` / `VirtualFree`, returning pages straight to
  the OS. Cap chunk size at 256 MiB so a 1 GiB parse no longer
  reserves 2 GiB of slack.
- **Per-request arena**: completion, hover, documentHighlight, goto,
  rename, formatting all run inside a transient arena that's
  reclaimed when the handler returns. Zed's "fire completion on every
  character" pattern was the dominant leak; on a 5000-stmt union it
  cost 150-300 MiB per request that nothing freed.
- **Cached lower output**: `load_into_with_cache` now lowers each
  imported file at populate time and stores the typer-ready stmts.
  The user-pass lower (`lower_program_user_only`) skips top-level
  stmts whose origin doesn't match the user buffer, so editing a
  small file with stdlib imports doesn't reallocate fn_body /
  then_body / else_body / impl_methods Vectors for the whole stdlib
  on every keystroke.
- **O(N) jp_unescape**: the JSON parser's escape-decoding path was
  O(N²) (concat-byte-by-byte). On Zed's didChange payloads (full
  file content with escaped newlines) it allocated multi-GiB of
  throwaway strings per request. Replaced with a single arena buffer
  that's written byte-by-byte then cast to string.
- **Heap cache keys**: parse_cache keys now strdup'd into libc heap
  so they outlive every keystroke's arena reset. Without this the
  second didOpen segfaulted on cache.contains lookup against a freed
  string.
- **Runtime string ops via __glide_palloc**: `__glide_string_concat`,
  `_substring`, `_format`, `_int_to_string`, `_char_to_string` route
  through the active arena instead of libc malloc. Outside the LSP
  the arena is null and they fall back to calloc, so build / run /
  fmt paths see no behavior change.
- **JSON tree freed**: `lsp_main` now calls `json_free(req)` on the
  parsed request tree and `free` on the raw read buffer at the end
  of each loop iteration. `handle_did_open` / `handle_did_change`
  free the prior `doc.text` after replacement.
- **Lexer / Parser / Typer**: `__glide_pfree` (free that's safe on
  arena pointers) now used in their `.free()` methods so calling
  them while inside an arena is a no-op.

Smoke tests with realistic Zed-style traffic (didChange + completion
+ documentHighlight per keystroke):

  - bootstrap/main.glide (entry point, imports the whole bootstrap):
    1.3 GiB baseline (the AST cache itself), stable across 50 iters
    where the previous build climbed to 15 GiB.
  - bootstrap/lsp.glide: 30 MiB total, stable.

The 1.3 GiB baseline for main.glide-shaped graphs is the AST cache
for transitively-imported files (~70 MiB / file × 18 files). Reducing
it further needs a smaller AST representation or a lazy-import scheme
that doesn't parse symbol bodies until they're queried.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-05

First release. Glide is a self-hosted, plug-and-play systems language with
no Rust or system C compiler required.

### Language

- **Memory model**: function-scoped borrows (no lifetime annotations), auto-drop
  via `let v* = …`, arenas, `defer`. Borrow checker enforces dangling-return,
  call-site aliasing, double-borrow-across-stmt, and four other invariants.
- **Errors as values**: `!T` result type, `?` propagation, `ok` / `err` builtins.
- **Generics**: monomorphized; inference from args + return hints + first method
  call on a `let v = Generic::new()` binding. Bounds: `<T: A + B>` checked at
  call sites.
- **Traits**: `trait` + `impl Trait for T`, `Self`, default methods,
  supertraits, `*dyn Trait` runtime dispatch via vtable + thunks.
- **Concurrency**: M:N coroutines (`spawn`) on top of a custom asm context
  switch (~10–15 ns), Vyukov MPMC chan with cache-padded cells, work-stealing,
  `sleep_ms` async (parks coro, frees worker), `while let v = c.recv()`
  close-detect.
- **Closures**: anonymous `fn(args) -> ret { … }` lifted to top-level
  (capture-less), passable as `fn(int) -> int` parameter.
- **Macros**: `macro name!($x:expr) { … }` non-variadic + `$($x:expr),*` variadic;
  call sites at stmt position, method position (`v.push_all!(…)`), and path
  position (`Type::name!(…)`). Expander runs between parse and typer.
- **Inline asm**: `asm { "…" : "=a"(out), "…"(in) }` GCC-style operand lists.
  `naked fn` for raw-asm bodies. `@cfg("posix"|"windows")` attribute. `c_raw! { … }`
  emits arbitrary C verbatim into the output.
- **String interpolation**: `"hello, ${name}!"` lowers to `format!(…)` at parse.
- **Imports**: bare path `import a::b::c;`, wildcard `import a::b::*;`, brace list
  `import a::b::{X, Y};`. Multi-segment paths auto-resolve to module files.

### Toolchain

- Single archive bundles everything: the `glide` binary, the auto-injected
  `src/builtins/`, the opt-in `src/stdlib/`, and a Zig toolchain (clang + libcs
  + linker for cross-compile).
- Subcommands: `glide build / run / emit / check / fmt / ast / lsp`.
- Cross-compilation via `--target=<triple>` (e.g. `x86_64-linux-gnu`,
  `aarch64-macos`, `x86_64-windows-gnu`).
- Output binary is a normal native exe with no Glide / Zig runtime dependency.
- `tools/install.{sh,ps1}` install the archive into `~/.local/share/glide`
  (Linux/macOS) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Glide` (Windows). No admin required.

### LSP

`glide lsp` over JSON-RPC stdio. Supports:

- **Diagnostics** with stable codes covering type errors, borrow rules,
  null-safety, unused vars / fns / params, unnecessary `mut`, dead code after
  return, missing return, arena leaks, `&temporary`, missing trait method,
  unsatisfied bound, trait-method-mismatch.
- **Hover** with doc-comment extraction for user fns/structs and built-in docs
  for keywords / macros.
- **Completion** with `.` and `:` trigger characters: locals, top-level decls,
  keywords, chan ops on `c.`, `Type::method` paths, struct fields.
- **Goto definition** for fns, struct fields, impl methods (including
  `Vector::new`, `c.send`, chained inline ctors, qualified paths).
- **Find references / document highlight** across the open file.
- **Document symbols** for outline.
- **Rename + prepareRename** (rejects keywords; precise word range).
- **Document formatting** via fmt.glide round-trip.

### Editors

- **Zed**: extension under `zed-extension/` invokes `glide lsp`. Tree-sitter
  grammar at `glide-grammar/` covers the full surface (traits, dyn, asm,
  naked, c_raw, @cfg, generic bounds, qualified imports).
- **VSCode**: extension under `vscode-extension/` with file-extension icon,
  syntax highlighting (TextMate), and LSP integration via
  `vscode-languageclient`.

### Bootstrap

- Compiler is ~12K LOC of Glide under `bootstrap/`.
- `bootstrap/seed/bootstrap.c` is the auto-emitted C seed for fresh machines:
  `cc bootstrap/seed/bootstrap.c -o glide_seed && ./glide_seed build bootstrap/main.glide -o glide`.
- Runtime impl externalized to `bootstrap/runtime/` (chan template, sched, sockets,
  prelude, stdlib helpers).

### Performance vs Go 1.26 (Windows 11, median of 5 runs)

| bench                       | Glide     | Go     | result                |
|-----------------------------|-----------|--------|-----------------------|
| Spawn + drain 100K          | 6 ms      | 10 ms  | Glide 1.7× faster     |
| Spawn + drain 1M            | 85 ms     | 94 ms  | Glide 1.1× faster     |
| Pure chan 1M (cap = 1024)   | 24 ms     | 48 ms  | Glide 2.0× faster     |
| RAM idle 100K parked        | 448 MB    | 903 MB | Glide 2.0× lighter    |
| Throughput spawn+chan 100K  | 486 ms    | 436 ms | Glide 1.1× off        |

### Known limitations

- Formatter drops comments (lexer doesn't track them yet); `glide fmt --write`
  is opt-in for that reason.
- No NLL — borrow lifetimes are block-scoped.
- No `move` returns — owned values can't escape their declaring fn.
- No `?T` nullable type yet — only borrows are non-null by check; `*T` remains
  nullable.
- Default trait method copy with mixed override / inherit patterns can produce
  incorrect codegen (workaround: override in every impl). Tracked.
- `let v* = Vector::new()` followed by use through a borrow doesn't infer `T`
  (workaround: explicit `let v: *Vector<int> = …`). Tracked.
- Reactor / async I/O, `async fn`, stack growth, `Mutex<T>`,
  `select!` over multiple chans: deferred to a future release.
